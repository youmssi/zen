name: ux-typography
description: Audits typography for readability and hierarchy (type scale, font sizes, weights, line height, line length, letter spacing, font loading, numerals, truncation and text zoom) by extracting every text style from CSS, theme tokens and components and checking them against readability research and WCAG. Use when reviewing fonts, text styles, readability, headings, or text-heavy screens.

# Typography (TYP)

## Senior mindset

"95% of web design is typography" (Oliver Reichenstein) is an exaggeration with a true core: **most of what users do in a product is read**. A senior treats type as the main way to create hierarchy. **Size, weight and color**, used sparingly, can structure an entire screen without a single box or border.

They check typography in three layers:
1. **System:** is there a deliberate, small type scale (about 4–6 sizes), or 23 one-off sizes?
2. **Readability:** can the target user read it comfortably on the target device (size, contrast, line length, line height)?
3. **Behavior:** what happens with long text, translations, zoom at 200%, a missing font, or numbers in a table?

## Scope

- **In:** font families and fallbacks, type scale, sizes, weights, line height, line length, letter spacing, case usage, paragraph spacing, numerals (tabular/proportional), truncation and wrapping, font loading (FOIT/FOUT), text resize and spacing (WCAG 1.4.4, 1.4.12), hierarchy of headings.
- **Out:** text color contrast (→ COL; measure jointly), copy content (→ CONT), heading semantics for screen readers (→ A11Y).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Extract the type system
- Find tokens or theme: `fontSize`, `--font-size-*`, `text-xs…text-9xl` usage, `Typography` variants (`h1…body2`), `TextStyle`, `.font(`.
- Find every **actual** size used in code: `font-size:\s*[\d.]+(px|rem|em)`, Tailwind `text-(xs|sm|base|lg|xl|\d?xl|\[.*?\])`.
- Build a table: **style name · size · line height · weight · letter spacing · usage count**. Flag sizes that are not in the scale.

### Step 2: Evaluate the scale
- A healthy UI uses **4–6 sizes** in daily use (e.g. 12/14/16/20/24/32), ideally on a ratio (1.125–1.333) or a curated set.
- Adjacent hierarchy levels need **visible contrast**. Two sizes 1 px apart create ambiguity instead of hierarchy.
- Weights: typically 2–3 weights (regular, medium/semibold, bold). Using 5+ weights is noise.

### Step 3: Readability checks
- **Body size:** ≥ 16 px for general web products. Dense pro tools may use 13–14 px if contrast is strong and zoom works. Never < 12 px for any meaningful text.
- **Line height:** body 1.4–1.6; headings 1.1–1.3; UI labels around 1.2–1.4.
- **Line length:** 45–75 characters for paragraphs. The most reliable rule in code is a `max-width` in `ch` (e.g. `max-width: 65ch`). For pixel widths, a rough estimate is that an average character is about 0.5 em wide, so a 16 px body text column of 700 px holds about 85 characters.
- **Paragraph spacing:** visible, around 0.75–1.5× the font size.
- **Letter spacing:** positive tracking for ALL CAPS small labels (+0.05 em to +0.1 em); never tighten body text.
- **Case:** avoid ALL CAPS for long text (slower reading); sentence case for UI labels is more readable and friendlier (and avoids inconsistent title case).
- **Alignment:** left-aligned (start-aligned) body text; avoid justified text on the web (rivers); avoid multi-line centered text.

### Step 4: Behavior checks
- **Text resize (WCAG 1.4.4):** sizes in `rem`/`em` (or platform dynamic type), not fixed `px` everywhere. Does the layout survive 200% zoom?
- **Text spacing (WCAG 1.4.12):** containers don't clip when line-height is set to 1.5 and letter spacing to 0.12 em (no fixed `height` plus `overflow: hidden` on text).
- **Dynamic Type / font scaling** on mobile (iOS Dynamic Type, Android `sp` units). Check that `allowFontScaling={false}` and `maxFontSizeMultiplier` aren't abused.
- **Truncation:** ellipsis only where the full text is reachable (tooltip, expand, detail view). Never truncate critical information (amounts, names in confirmation dialogs).
- **Wrapping:** long words or URLs (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`), and long translations (→ I18N).
- **Numerals:** tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) in tables, counters, prices and timers, so digits don't jitter.
- **Font loading:** `font-display: swap` or `optional`; preload critical fonts; fallback metrics matched (`size-adjust`) to avoid layout shift; a system font stack as fallback.

### Step 5: Hierarchy check per screen
- Exactly one H1-level visual heading per page.
- Heading levels visually distinct and in order.
- Labels vs. values distinguishable (e.g. muted label, strong value).

## Criteria

| TYP-02 | Off-scale sizes | Count sizes not in the scale | Any frequent off-scale size | S1–S2 |
| TYP-03 | Body text size | Computed body size | < 16 px for a general audience; < 12 px anywhere meaningful | S2–S3 |
| TYP-04 | Line height | Body and heading line heights | Body < 1.4 or > 1.8 | S2 |
| TYP-05 | Line length | Container width for paragraphs | > ~80–90 characters, or < ~35 for body text | S2 |
| TYP-06 | Distinct hierarchy levels | Size and weight steps between levels | Adjacent levels nearly identical; level order inverted | S2 |
| TYP-07 | Weight discipline | Weights in use | > 3–4 weights; bold used for emphasis everywhere | S1 |
| TYP-08 | Case usage | ALL CAPS and title-case patterns | Long uppercase text; inconsistent casing across UI | S1–S2 |

| TYP-13 | Long-string wrapping | overflow-wrap on user content, URLs, emails | Horizontal overflow or broken layout | S2 |
| TYP-14 | Tabular numerals where numbers align or change | `tabular-nums` in tables, counters, prices | Jittering counters; misaligned numeric columns | S1–S2 |
| TYP-15 | Font loading strategy | `font-display`, preload, fallback stack | Invisible text during load; large layout shift from font swap | S2 |
| TYP-16 | Font family count | Families loaded | > 2 families (excluding monospace) without reason; heavy font payload | S1–S2 (→ PERF) |
| TYP-17 | Monospace for code and IDs | Code, keys, IDs in monospace | Code in a proportional font; ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/l/I) in IDs | S1–S2 |
| TYP-18 | Readable on all backgrounds | Text over images or gradients has a scrim or overlay | Text over busy imagery | S2 (→ COL) |

## Code probes

- Sizes: `font-size:`, `fontSize:`, `text-\[`, `TextStyle\(`, `.font\(.system\(size:`.
- Line height: `line-height:`, `leading-`.
- Units: count `px` vs `rem` in font sizes.
- Scaling disabled: `allowFontScaling={false}`, `maximum-scale=1`, `user-scalable=no`.
- Justify: `text-align:\s*justify`, `text-justify`.
- Fonts: `@font-face`, `font-display`, `next/font`, `<link[^>]*fonts.googleapis`.
- Numerals: `tabular-nums`, `font-variant-numeric`.

## Output

- A type system table (style · size · line height · weight · usage count · on-scale?).
- Findings in the standard format; the coverage table (TYP-01 … TYP-18).

## Done when

The full type inventory is extracted, the scale is evaluated, readability is checked on critical screens, and zoom/spacing behavior is verified at runtime or marked Not verified.
