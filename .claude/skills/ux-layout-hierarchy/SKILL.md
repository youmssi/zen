description: Audits screen composition (grid, spacing scale, alignment, grouping, visual hierarchy, element placement, density, whitespace, reading patterns, primary-action emphasis, Fitts's-law reachability and above-the-fold priorities) from CSS, layout code and screenshots, with measurable rules for where each element should sit and why. Use when reviewing page layouts, dashboards, positioning, sizing and spacing of elements, or when a screen "feels cluttered" or "unbalanced".

# Layout and Visual Hierarchy (LAY)

## Senior mindset

A senior designer looking at a screen does a **squint test** first: blur the screen (or literally squint) and ask, **"What do I see first, second and third? Is that the right order for the user's job?"** Hierarchy is not decoration. It is the **order of attention**, and it should match the **order of importance for the task**.

They then check the **invisible structure**: every element sits on a grid, every space comes from a scale, and every group is separated more from its neighbors than its members are from each other. When those three rules hold, a screen feels "calm" without anyone knowing why. When they break, it feels "off" even to people who can't say what's wrong.

Placement is **not arbitrary**. It comes from:
- **Reading patterns:** F-pattern for text-heavy screens, Z-pattern for sparse ones; in left-to-right languages the top-left gets the most attention (mirrored in RTL).
- **Fitts's law:** frequent, important actions are big and close to the user's attention or thumb.
- **Conventions (Jakob's law):** logo top-left, account top-right, primary action bottom-right in dialogs on the web (platform conventions vary; see RESP).
- **Proximity to the thing it acts on:** an action sits next to its object, not in a distant toolbar.

ChatGPT's layout shows this: one narrow centered reading column (~700 px) for readable line length, the input pinned at the bottom near where the eye ends after reading, and secondary features (history, settings) in a collapsible side panel.

## Scope

- **In:** grids and columns, spacing scale and rhythm, alignment, grouping and proximity, hierarchy (size, weight, color, position, whitespace), primary/secondary/tertiary action emphasis, placement of key elements, density, whitespace, scanning paths, above-the-fold content, sticky elements, z-order and overlays, layout stability.
- **Out:** font scale details (→ TYP), color values and contrast (→ COL), breakpoint behavior (→ RESP), component consistency (→ DS).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Pick the screens
Audit **every critical-flow screen** (from FLOW) plus the main templates (list, detail, form, dashboard, settings, empty state, modal). Capture screenshots at 1440, 1024, 768 and 375 px if runtime is available.

### Step 2: Squint test and attention order (per screen)
1. Write the **intended** attention order: what the user needs first, second, third for their job on this screen.
2. Write the **actual** attention order (from screenshots, or by reasoning from size, weight, color and position in code).
3. Any mismatch is a hierarchy finding. Typical case: a decorative banner or a secondary filter bar dominates the primary content.

### Step 3: Primary action analysis
- **Exactly one primary action per view** (filled or high-contrast button). Count elements styled as primary (`variant="primary"`, `btn-primary`, solid fills).
- Secondary actions use an outline/ghost style; tertiary actions are links.
- **Placement:** the primary action sits at the end of the reading path of the content it commits (bottom of a form, bottom-right of a dialog on web/desktop; full-width or bottom-anchored on mobile).
- **Destructive actions** are not styled as primary unless destruction *is* the purpose of the dialog. They are separated from frequent actions by distance.

### Step 4: Spacing system audit
- Extract every spacing value used: `margin`, `padding`, `gap`, `space-*`, Tailwind spacing classes, `EdgeInsets`, etc.
- Build a **histogram** of values. A healthy product uses a small set from a **4/8 pt scale**. Flag off-scale values (e.g. 13 px, 17 px, 22 px) and an excessive variety (> ~10 distinct values).
- **Proximity rule:** for each group (card, form section, list item), internal spacing must be smaller than external spacing. A common healthy ratio is 1:2 (e.g. 8 inside, 16 between; 16 inside, 32 between sections).

### Step 5: Grid and alignment
- Is there a column grid (12-column on desktop, 4–8 on mobile) or a consistent layout primitive (`Container`, `Stack`, `Grid`)?
- Check the **alignment edges**: count the distinct left edges on a screen. Fewer is calmer. Labels, inputs and buttons should share edges.
- Check numeric alignment: right-align numbers in tables, align decimal places (→ DATA).
- Check that the max content width is set for reading (~600–760 px for text) and that wide screens don't stretch forms to 1400 px.

### Step 6: Density and whitespace
- Match density to the user (CTX): experts in data tools want density (with good alignment); occasional users need more whitespace and fewer elements.
- Count the **elements competing for attention** above the fold. More than ~5–7 visually strong elements equals clutter.
- Whitespace is used to **group and separate**, not just added uniformly.

### Step 7: Placement and reachability (Fitts)
- Size of frequent targets: desktop buttons ≥ 32–40 px tall for primary actions; touch ≥ 44 pt (iOS) / 48 dp (Android). WCAG 2.5.8 minimum 24×24 CSS px.
- **Distance:** the action is near its object (row actions on hover or at the row's end; a "Save" bar near the edited content or sticky).
- **Mobile thumb zone:** primary actions in the lower half; destructive actions not in the easiest-to-hit zone.
- **Edge targets:** on desktop, toolbar items at screen edges are easier to hit.

### Step 8: Stability and overlays
- **Layout shift:** content jumping when images, ads, fonts or async data load (CLS; → PERF). Check that images have width/height or aspect-ratio, and that skeletons match final sizes.
- **Sticky elements:** sticky headers and bars stealing too much viewport (> ~20–25% on mobile) or hiding focused elements (WCAG 2.4.11).
- **Z-order:** a z-index system rather than `9999` wars; modals, toasts and dropdowns layer predictably.

## Code probes

- Spacing values: `(margin|padding|gap)(-\w+)?:\s*\d+px`, Tailwind `\b(p|m|gap|space-[xy])-?[trblxy]?-(\d+|\[.*?\])`, `EdgeInsets\.`, `padding\(`.
- Arbitrary values: `-\[\d+px\]`.
- Primary buttons: `variant=["']primary`, `btn-primary`, `color="primary"`, `type="submit"`.
- Width constraints: `max-w-`, `max-width`, `Container`.
- Z-index: `z-index:\s*\d+`, `z-\[?\d+`.
- Images without dimensions: `<img(?![^>]*(width|height))`, `next/image` without `fill` or sizes.

## Anti-patterns

- Everything bold, so nothing stands out.
- Two primary buttons side by side ("Save" and "Publish", both solid).
- Card soup: every piece of content boxed, borders everywhere instead of whitespace grouping.
- Centered body text over multiple lines (it's hard to find the next line start).
- Full-width text on large monitors.
- Floating action button and sticky footer and sticky header and chat bubble together on mobile.

## Output

- Per screen: the intended vs. actual attention order, primary-action analysis, and a spacing/alignment summary.
- A product-wide spacing histogram and target-size violations list.
- Findings in the standard format; the coverage table (LAY-01 … LAY-20).

## Done when

Every critical-flow screen has passed the squint test and primary-action analysis, the spacing histogram is computed, and target sizes are checked (measured or static).
