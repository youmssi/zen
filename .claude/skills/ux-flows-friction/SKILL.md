name: ux-flows-friction
description: Maps and stress-tests the product's critical user flows step by step (entry point, screens, decisions, inputs, system responses, completion) to find bottlenecks, dead ends, redundant steps, memory burdens, decision overload, break points and drop-off risks, and proposes removals, merges and reorderings. Use when analyzing a workflow, funnel, wizard, checkout, sign-up, or any multi-step task, or when asked why users drop off.

# Flows and Friction (FLOW)

## Senior mindset

Junior designers review **screens**. Seniors review **transitions**: what the user knows, wants and holds in their head **between** screens. Almost every severe UX failure happens at a seam: after a redirect, after an email link, after an error, after a timeout, after switching devices.

A senior reads a flow like an engineer reads a hot code path: **count the operations, find the slowest one, and remove anything that isn't necessary**. Their order of operations is always:
1. **Remove** steps (the best step is no step: infer, default, defer, automate).
2. **Merge** steps (ask for related things together).
3. **Reorder** (value before effort; easy before hard; commitment escalates gradually).
4. Only then **redesign** the remaining steps.

Cal.com's booking flow is a good model. The guest never creates an account, the time zone is detected rather than asked, and the date and time are chosen on one screen. The flow is **defined by what was removed**.

## Scope

- **In:** every critical flow from CTX (sign-up, onboarding, core job, payment, sharing, recovery, cancellation/deletion), step and decision counts, input burden, seams (emails, redirects, OAuth, payment providers, device switches), interruption and resumption, drop-off risks, redundant work, flow-level error recovery.
- **Out:** detailed field-level form design (→ FORM), state visuals (→ STATE), copy wording (→ CONT). Reference them; don't re-audit them.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Get the flow list
Take the critical flows from the CTX context brief. If CTX did not run, derive them from routes plus the standard list: sign-up/install, first value, core job, payment/upgrade, invite/share, password reset, cancel/delete/export.

### Step 2: Trace each flow from code and/or runtime
For each flow, build a **step table**:

| # | Screen / route / file | User intent | User action(s) | Inputs required | Decisions | System response & latency | Feedback shown | Possible failures | Exit/back |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- Follow the actual code path: route → component → submit handler → API → redirect target. Note **every redirect** (`redirect(`, `router.push`, `navigate(`, `window.location`) and every **external hop** (email, OAuth, Stripe, 3-D Secure, SMS).
- If runtime is available, actually perform the flow (Playwright or browser), and record screenshots and timings.

### Step 3: Compute flow metrics
- **Steps:** the number of distinct screens or states the user must pass.
- **Interactions:** clicks, taps and keystrokes on the happy path (a rough KLM-style count: each field ≈ 1 click + typing; each choice ≈ 1 click).
- **Decisions:** the number of points where the user must choose. Weight decisions with more than 5 options as heavier (Hick's law).
- **Inputs:** the number of fields, and how many could be inferred, defaulted or deferred.
- **Memory load:** any information the user must carry from one step to another (codes, names, earlier choices).
- **Seams:** context switches (another app, email, another device, another tab).
- **Time to value:** steps before the user receives the first benefit.

### Step 4: Find friction, using this checklist on each step
1. **Necessity:** what would break if this step disappeared? If "nothing for the user", remove or defer it.
2. **Inference:** could the system know this already? (Locale, time zone, country from IP, company from email domain, card type from number, city from postal code.)
3. **Default:** is there a safe default most users would accept?
4. **Deferral:** can this be asked later, when it is needed? (Profile details, team invites, preferences.)
5. **Order:** does the user get value before being asked for effort? (Let users try before signing up when feasible.)
6. **Commitment escalation:** small commitments first; big ones (payment, permissions) only after value is felt.
7. **Decision quality:** does the user have enough information **at this moment** to decide? If not, they stall or guess.
8. **Feedback:** after each action, does the user know it worked and what comes next?
9. **Reversibility:** can they go back without losing work?
10. **Interruption:** if they leave mid-flow (close tab, phone call, email verification), can they resume where they were?

### Step 5: Stress-test the seams (where flows break)
For each seam, test or reason through:
- **Email verification / magic link:** opened on another device or browser? Link expired? Already used? Does it return the user to where they were, with their intent preserved?
- **OAuth / SSO:** user denies permission; account exists with another method; returns to the right page with state.
- **Payment:** card declined; 3-D Secure challenge; network drop after charge; double-submit; return URL; receipts.
- **Session expiry mid-flow:** is data preserved and re-auth seamless?
- **Back / refresh / duplicate tab** inside a wizard.
- **Concurrency:** two users editing; stale data.
- **Permissions:** user lacks access halfway through. Does the flow say who can grant it?

### Step 6: Identify break points and drop-off risk
Rank steps by **drop-off risk**, using:
- Effort spike (many fields, uploads, verification)
- Uncertainty spike (unclear pricing, unclear consequences)
- Trust spike (payment, permissions, personal data)
- Waiting (verification emails, processing)
- Context switch (leaving the app)

If analytics exist, compare with real funnel data (→ MEAS). Otherwise label risk as **inferred**.

### Step 7: Propose the optimized flow
For each flow, write the **proposed step table** next to the current one, and quantify the change: "From 9 steps / 14 fields / 3 seams to 5 steps / 6 fields / 1 seam". Classify each change as **Remove / Merge / Reorder / Infer / Default / Defer / Redesign**.

## Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Check | Fail signal | Default severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FLOW-01 | Every critical flow is completable | Trace end to end | Any break, dead end or missing step | S4 |
| FLOW-02 | Minimal steps | Each step passes the necessity test | ≥ 1 removable step on a critical flow | S2–S3 |
| FLOW-03 | Minimal input | Fields that could be inferred, defaulted or deferred | Asking for known or unnecessary data | S2 |
| FLOW-04 | Value before effort | Time-to-value step count; sign-up or payment placement | Heavy commitment before any value | S2–S3 |
| FLOW-05 | Decisions are informed and few | Decision points have the needed info and sensible defaults | Choices the user cannot evaluate yet; more than ~7 equal options | S2 |
| FLOW-06 | No memory burden across steps | The user needn't remember data between screens | Copying codes or IDs between screens; re-entering earlier data (WCAG 3.3.7) | S2–S3 |
| FLOW-07 | Clear progress and orientation | Multi-step flows show step X of Y or a progress indicator | Unknown length; surprise extra steps | S2 |
| FLOW-08 | Feedback after every action | Each action produces a visible result within 1 s | Silent success; silent failure | S3 (S4 if silent failure) |
| FLOW-09 | Back and edit without data loss | Back or edit within the flow preserves inputs | Inputs cleared; must restart | S3 |
| FLOW-10 | Interruption-safe | Drafts are saved; resumable after leaving or a session timeout | Progress lost on tab close or timeout | S3 |
| FLOW-11 | Seams preserve intent | After email, OAuth or payment redirects, the user lands at their goal with context | Lands on a generic dashboard; intent lost | S3 |
| FLOW-12 | Edge seams handled | Expired or used links, declined cards, denied OAuth, double submit | Raw errors, or the user is stuck | S3–S4 |
| FLOW-13 | Idempotent critical actions | Double click or retry doesn't double-charge or double-create | Duplicates | S4 for payments, S3 otherwise |
| FLOW-14 | Exit flows are as easy as entry flows | Cancel, downgrade, delete and export are reachable and proportional | Cancellation harder than sign-up (also legal risk, → TRUST) | S3 |
| FLOW-15 | Error recovery inside the flow | Errors are recoverable in place, with inputs kept | Error page that discards progress | S3 |
| FLOW-16 | Expert efficiency | Repeated flows have shortcuts: bulk actions, templates, duplicate, keyboard | Experts forced through the novice wizard every time | S2 |
| FLOW-17 | Permission and role dead ends | Users without permission see why and how to get access | Blank screen or a generic 403 | S2–S3 |
| FLOW-18 | Consistent flow patterns | Similar tasks (create X, create Y) follow the same pattern | Each creation flow behaves differently | S2 |
| FLOW-19 | Confirmation proportional to risk | Low-risk: no confirmation (use undo); high-risk: explicit confirmation | Confirm dialogs everywhere (users stop reading them) or nowhere | S2–S4 |
| FLOW-20 | Completion is clear | The end state confirms success and suggests the next step | Flow ends on an ambiguous screen | S2 |

## Code probes

- Redirects: `redirect(`, `router.push(`, `router.replace(`, `navigate(`, `window.location`, `Response.redirect`.
- Multi-step wizards: `step`, `currentStep`, `setStep`, `Stepper`, `wizard`.
- Draft persistence: `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `autosave`, `draft`, `persist`.
- Double-submit protection: `disabled={isSubmitting}`, `idempotency`, `Idempotency-Key`, debounce on submit.
- Token and link expiry handling: `expired`, `invalid token`, `TokenExpiredError`.

## Output

- For each critical flow: the current step table, metrics, ranked break points, the proposed step table, and the delta metrics.
- Findings in the standard format (flow-level issues; reference other sub-skills for screen-level issues).
- The coverage table (FLOW-01 … FLOW-20).

## Done when

Every critical flow has been traced end to end (runtime or code), every seam has been tested or marked Not verified, and every flow has a proposed optimized version with quantified deltas.
