description: Establishes who the product is for, what jobs they hire it to do, in what context, with what mental models, and how success is measured, reconstructed from the codebase, docs, copy, analytics and any research available. Produces personas, jobs-to-be-done, critical flows and assumptions that every other ux-* sub-skill uses to judge severity. Use first in any UX audit, or whenever user goals are unclear.

# UX Context Discovery (CTX)

## Senior mindset

A 25-year UX veteran never opens Figma or a component file first. They ask: **"Who is trying to get what done, in what situation, and what does 'done well' feel like to them?"** Every later judgment (is 5 steps too many? is this label clear?) is only answerable relative to a specific user, goal and context. A dense trading dashboard and a first-time banking app follow opposite rules. Without context, an audit is just a list of opinions.

They also know the context is usually **not written down**. It has to be **reconstructed from evidence**: the product's own copy, its data model, its pricing, its onboarding questions, its analytics events, its support docs and its issue tracker.

## Scope

- **In:** target users and segments, jobs-to-be-done (JTBD), context of use (device, environment, frequency, expertise, stress), mental models and vocabulary, business goals, success metrics, constraints, competitive and convention baseline, assumptions and risks.
- **Out:** detailed screen-level critique (hand off to the other sub-skills).

## Inputs to gather (in this order of reliability)

1. **Existing research:** `docs/`, `research/`, personas, interview notes, survey results, usability-test reports, `*.md` in the repo root, the product brief, the PRD.
2. **The product's own words:** landing page, README, onboarding questions, pricing tiers, empty-state copy, email templates. These reveal who the team *thinks* the user is.
3. **The data model:** database schema and migrations (`schema.prisma`, `migrations/`, `models.py`, ORM entities). Entities and fields reveal the real objects users work with (e.g. `Workspace`, `Invoice`, `Rule`) and roles (`role: admin|member|viewer`).
4. **Permissions and roles:** RBAC config, `can(`, `hasPermission`, policies. These reveal the distinct user types.
5. **Analytics events:** `track(`, `capture(`, `logEvent(`. These reveal what the team considers success.
6. **Support signals:** issue tracker labels, `FAQ`, help-center links, `CHANGELOG` "fix" entries, recurring bug themes.
7. **Market baseline:** the 2–3 leading products in the category (their conventions set user expectations, per Jakob's law).

If the user can answer questions, ask **at most 5** targeted questions (see Step 7). Otherwise proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Product one-liner
Write: "**<Product>** helps **<primary user>** to **<core job>** so that **<outcome>**, unlike **<main alternative>**." If you cannot write it from the evidence, that is itself finding **CTX-01**.

### Step 2: User segments and roles
From roles, pricing tiers, onboarding branches and copy, list the segments. For each, give:
- Role / segment name (use the product's own term)
- Expertise: novice / intermediate / expert, in the **domain** and in **technology**, separately
- Frequency: daily / weekly / occasional / once
- Device and context: desktop at a desk, phone on the move, shared screen, noisy floor, field work, under time pressure
- Accessibility considerations: assume a realistic share of users have permanent, temporary or situational disabilities
- Motivation: required by their job (low motivation, high necessity) or chosen voluntarily

Keep it to **2–4 primary segments**. Personas are working tools, not fiction. No stock photos, no hobbies.

### Step 3: Jobs-to-be-done
For each segment, list jobs in the form: **"When <situation>, I want to <motivation>, so I can <expected outcome>."**
Rank them by **frequency × importance**. Mark the top 3–5 as **critical jobs**.

Also capture **functional**, **emotional** ("feel confident I didn't make a mistake") and **social** ("look competent to my boss") dimensions. Emotional jobs often explain why "simple" products win: ChatGPT's single input box removes the fear of "using it wrong".

### Step 4: Critical flows
Map each critical job to a concrete flow in the product: entry point → steps → completion signal. Always include these flows when they exist:
1. Discovery → sign-up / install
2. First-run → first value ("aha" moment)
3. The core repeated job
4. Payment / upgrade
5. Collaboration / sharing
6. Recovery: password reset, error recovery, undo
7. Exit: cancel, delete account, export data

Hand this list to `ux-flows-friction`.

### Step 5: Mental model and vocabulary
- List the **nouns** users think in (from the data model plus copy) and check they match. For example, the code says `Organization`, the UI says `Team`, and the docs say `Workspace`: three names for one concept.
- List the **verbs** (actions) and where they live.
- Note domain conventions users bring with them (e.g. accountants expect a ledger layout; developers expect a CLI `--help`).

### Step 6: Success metrics and business goals
- North-star metric (if stated or inferable).
- Activation definition (what action predicts retention?).
- The analytics events that exist for critical jobs; gaps go to `ux-measurement-validation`.
- Business constraints: compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2), regulated industries, enterprise buyers vs. end users (buyer ≠ user creates different UX needs, such as admin consoles and audit logs).

### Step 7: Assumptions and open questions
List every assumption with a **risk level** (if wrong, how much does the audit change?). If the user is reachable, ask the top 3–5 questions, for example:
- "Who is the primary user: <A> or <B>?"
- "What does a successful first session look like?"
- "Which platform matters most at launch?"
- "Are there legal or accessibility obligations (public sector, EU EAA, Section 508)?"
- "Is there existing research or analytics we can use?"

## Criteria

| ID | Criterion | How to check | Fail signal | Default severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CTX-01 | Clear value proposition | Can the one-liner be written from the product's own landing/README/onboarding copy? | Copy describes features, not outcomes; the audience is unclear | S2 (S3 if this is the main acquisition page) |
| CTX-02 | Defined primary users | Roles/segments are identifiable and the product addresses them explicitly | One generic flow for very different users (admin vs. end user) | S2 |
| CTX-03 | Critical jobs supported end to end | Each critical job maps to an existing, complete flow | A job has no path, or requires leaving the product or a workaround | S3–S4 |
| CTX-04 | Vocabulary consistency | One name per concept across UI, docs, code-facing API and emails | ≥ 2 names for the same concept in user-facing text | S2 |
| CTX-05 | Matches user mental model | Structure follows how users think about the domain (not the database or org chart) | Navigation mirrors internal teams or tables | S2–S3 |
| CTX-06 | Context of use addressed | Product works in the dominant context (mobile on the go, low bandwidth, shared devices, gloves, sunlight) | Desktop-only design for a mostly-mobile segment | S3 |
| CTX-07 | Expertise range served | Novices can succeed and experts are not slowed down (shortcuts, bulk actions, defaults) | Only one of the two is served | S2 |
| CTX-08 | Success is defined and measurable | Activation and core-job success events exist | No analytics, or vanity metrics only | S2 (routes to MEAS) |
| CTX-09 | Constraints identified | Legal, compliance and accessibility obligations are known | Product targets a regulated domain with no visible handling | S3 |
| CTX-10 | Convention baseline known | Category conventions identified and deviations deliberate | Reinvents standard patterns without a benefit | S2 |
| CTX-11 | Buyer vs. user needs | If the buyer differs from the user, both have flows (admin, billing, reporting vs. daily use) | Missing admin, audit or reporting for B2B | S2–S3 |
| CTX-12 | Evidence base exists | Some research, feedback loop or analytics informs decisions | No feedback channel at all | S1–S2 (routes to MEAS) |

## Output

1. **Context brief** (this is what the orchestrator passes to every other sub-skill):

```markdown
## Context brief
**One-liner:** …
**Segments:**
| Segment | Domain expertise | Tech expertise | Frequency | Device/context | Motivation |
**Critical jobs (ranked):** 1. … 2. … 3. …
**Critical flows:** <job> → <entry> → … → <completion>
**Vocabulary map:** concept → UI term / docs term / code term (✅ consistent | ⚠️ drift)
**Success metrics:** north star · activation · per-job
**Constraints:** legal, compliance, accessibility, platform
**Convention baseline:** <category leaders and their key patterns>
**Assumptions (risk):** …
**Open questions:** …
```

2. Findings for any CTX criterion that fails (standard format).
3. The coverage table.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Inventing personas with names, ages and hobbies that nothing in the evidence supports.
- Treating "everyone" as the target user.
- Confusing the **customer** (who pays) with the **user** (who uses it every day).
- Skipping this step because "the product is obvious". Severity scoring will be arbitrary without it.

## Done when

- The context brief is complete, with each assumption labeled.
- Critical flows are listed, ready for `ux-flows-friction`.
- Every CTX criterion has a result in the coverage table.
